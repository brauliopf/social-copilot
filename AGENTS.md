- Keep the title concise and do not end it with a period.
- Include a concise summary explaining what changed and why.
- Include testing performed, including commands and their results.
- Call out breaking changes, migrations, configuration changes, and security considerations.
- Add screenshots or API examples when they make the change easier to review.
